It was launched on 14 July 2014 at the Farnborough Airshow, promising 14% better fuel economy per seat. It is exclusively powered by the Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 which has double the bypass ratio of its predecessor. Its two versions are based on the A330-200 and -300: the -800 has a range of 8,150 nmi (15,090 km; 9,380 mi) with 257 passengers while the -900 covers 7,200 nmi (13,330 km; 8,290 mi) with 287 passengers.";
